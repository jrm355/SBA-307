# Name: Good Dog Casting Agency
## Description: This is a literal dog casting page for a fictional company that I may decide to start eventually
## Tech used: lots of boot strap, I used canva to build the movie posters and gif. I googled a lot of my concepts and reworked the code to fit the page.  
## How to use: Casting website with clear instructions at the top to see information on the current project and a contact page
## Acknowledgements: All the good dogs, especially my dogs for being models. There are an absurd amount of dog puns, and for that I apologize.
### Page 1 Home: This is my home page greeting you to the website. Bootstrap grid is utilized here. 
### Page 2 Contact Casting: This is a contact us page. This page is made with bootstrap and style.css file
### Page 3 Current project: This page is used to give information about the fake movie. I used style2.css for only this page, as it felt easier to not mix the css files while using bootstrap. Unfortunately the top title formatting is a bit off from the bootstrap pages.
#### I had fun doing this, more than I thought I would. I'm a learn by doing person and this at the very least gave me a baseline on my capibilities and what I have to improve on. I did build wireframes but the final product differentiated from the greatly.
